# Executing the Pipeline

In this section, we describe how to run a pipeline you created using the Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment JupyterLab extension and summarize how Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment organizes and executes pipeline steps.

How to Run a Pipeline

To run an annotated notebook as a pipeline using Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment:
1.	Enter a name in the Select experiment field under the Pipeline Metadata heading or select an existing name from the pull-down menu. Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment enables you to group multiple pipeline runs together under the same experiment name. This simplifies comparisons across pipeline runs.

2.	Enter a name in the Pipeline Name field. Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment will use this name to identify your pipeline when producing output from a pipeline run, when creating snapshots.

3.	(Optional) Enter a description in the Pipeline Description field.

4.	Click the COMPILE AND RUN button at the bottom of the Katonic Automated Pipeline Deployment Panel.
